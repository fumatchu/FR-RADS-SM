This application is in Preview
**********************************${textreset}

Preview means that if it's working, technically, it's working.. the functionality is there. 
HOWEVER, there may be mis-spellings, grammatical erros (was one just made?).. 
Things may look weird in screen transitions..

This is a Work in Progress and will be updated soon.. 
Don't make fun of it :)
ENJOY!!!
